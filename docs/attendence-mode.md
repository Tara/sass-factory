The goal: who says they are comign to the show, and after the show, who actually attended.

Rough idea of how we can do it: I want to track attendance status for shows. Before a show, every member defaults to "unconfirmed". Until the show, we can change their status to "confirmed" or "not_attending". After the show, "confirmed" and "unconfirmed" members must manually be updated to "performed" or "no_show". Anyone who is marked as "not attending" remains as "not attending".

When viewing a show, we want to see the status of every member.

It's possible we'll add or remove members from the troupe, and it's not clear exactly how to track that. Make me some suggestions!
