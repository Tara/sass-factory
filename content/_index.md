title: "Welcome to Sass Factory"
---

Sass Factory Improv was formed in San Francisco in 2023 and has since performed across the Bay Area. Based on audience suggestions, Sass Factory produces a diverse array of profound and absurd characters in a whimsical, wacky, and wonderful narrative world. Dysfunctional relationships, high-stakes situations, big emotions, ridiculous antics, and a touch of sincerity all collide in every performance. Sass-i-faction is always, sometimes, guaranteed.
